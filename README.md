# TensorForce Tutorial Development

This repo contains some tutorials covering the implementation of Reinforcement Learning agents using the TensorForce framework.

# Getting started

In order to use these tutorials, OpenAI Gym and the TensorForce framework need to be installed.

To install GYM, please follow the instructions on [gym's github repository](https://github.com/openai/gym).

To install TensorForce, follow the instructions on the [TensorForce official website](https://tensorforce.readthedocs.io/en/latest/basics/installation.html)

# Tutorials

* Vanilla Policy Gradient agent in CartPole environment:
 > This tutorial consists of a detailed explaination of the TensorForce implementation of a Reinforcement Learning agent based on the Vanilla Policy Gradient (or REINFORCE) algorithm and its usage to solve the CartPole environment from the OpenAI Gym.
