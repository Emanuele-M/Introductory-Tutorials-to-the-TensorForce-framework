# TensorForce Tutorial Development

This repo contains some tutorials covering the implementation of Reinforcement Learning agents using the TensorForce framework.

# Getting started

In order to use these tutorials, OpenAI Gym and the TensorForce framework need to be installed.

To install OpenAI Gym, please follow the instructions on [Gym's github repository](https://github.com/openai/gym).

To install TensorForce, follow the instructions on the [TensorForce official website](https://tensorforce.readthedocs.io/en/latest/basics/installation.html).

# Tutorials
